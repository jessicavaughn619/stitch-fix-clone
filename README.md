# Stitch Fix Clone
I am a full-stack developer and have always held a love for fashion and style. I was introduced to Stitch Fix many years ago as a client and have been hooked on their personal styling service ever since. Stitch Fix is a dream company for me, therefore I was inspired to build a React UI clone to explore nuances of their UI.

## Installation
This project is containerized with Docker. If you do not have docker installed, check out the documentation [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started/).

Cd into the directory and run:

This command starts and runs a frontend React container.

To stop running and remove the container, run:
